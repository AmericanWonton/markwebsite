Okay, we've learned how to parse files in go and we're going to start making mark a basic ass website!
First things first, let's get all his photos off of Facebook...cuz they look good. The plan is to plop them into
extraneous_files, then decide which can go into img when we want to play with them.

Things to mess with: 
1. Facebook APIS. Might need for videos or messaging: 
https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/embedded-video-player/api
https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/embedded-video-player/

So I got a majority of Mark's photos but IDK if he's on Twitter...so it looks like just Facebook...

1. Made basic Go Templates...probably should make some basic page structure. 
2. I should mess with some requests and handling requests.
3. Before building the structure of the site, I should mess with some APIs or other features.
4. Maybe create a database in Mongo to keep track of who created a date for Mark, etc.?

For some reason I have to run golang again for the correct formatting a couple times...like I'll come back after running it 
and it's suddenly...fixed? IDK... 


Weird...my gohtml isn't syncing with my css files... is it something wrong with the templates?
Okay, it's a two part issue: One, I had to fix the stylesheet path after moving my CSS folder around.
Two, there's a rule for serving those CSS files, (I kind of had to dig for the right answer here):
