Okay, we've learned how to parse files in go and we're going to start making mark a basic ass website!
First things first, let's get all his photos off of Facebook...cuz they look good. The plan is to plop them into
extraneous_files, then decide which can go into img when we want to play with them.

Things to mess with: 
1. Facebook APIS. Might need for videos or messaging: 
https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/embedded-video-player/api
https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/embedded-video-player/
APIs with Golang: https://tutorialedge.net/golang/creating-restful-api-with-golang/

Here's a cool site to validate your CSS: http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator

So I got a majority of Mark's photos but IDK if he's on Twitter...so it looks like just Facebook...

1. Made basic Go Templates...probably should make some basic page structure. 
2. I should mess with some requests and handling requests.
3. Before building the structure of the site, I should mess with some APIs or other features.
4. Maybe create a database in Mongo to keep track of who created a date for Mark, etc.?

For some reason I have to run golang again for the correct formatting a couple times...like I'll come back after running it 
and it's suddenly...fixed? IDK... YOU GOTTA DO A HARD REFRESH OR CLEAR THE BROWSER CACHE TO GET IT TO WORK:

Or press CTRL + F5

Weird...my gohtml isn't syncing with my css files... is it something wrong with the templates?
Okay, it's a two part issue: One, I had to fix the stylesheet path after moving my CSS folder around.
Two, there's a rule for serving those CSS files, (I kind of had to dig for the right answer here):

Here is all of the Resources for getting Mark's site Online on GCloud
domain is djmark.net
gcloud app browse to look at it
Project Name: mark-website-275023
Config-Name: configname2
Target URL: https://mark-website-275023.uc.r.appspot.com
To browse all this, type in gcloud app browse
I might need to do this guy's word press example:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YkkqjwRqN4
Not really, it's not really pertinent, it's word press...let's just link this to our DNS.
Start by opening this link: https://cloud.google.com/dns/docs/quickstart

This setup is getting a little wonky...maybe try doing this on an Amazon server or learn how to 
point this project to a Google cloud instance with a mixture of that stuff Todd taught us for AWS?
Remember, select "windows" instructions for all that is below!
Generating an SSH key for our instance: https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/adding-removing-ssh-keys
Pt. 2: https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/adding-removing-ssh-keys#createsshkeys
Adding the key to Google Cloud: https://docs.bitnami.com/google/faq/get-started/connect-ssh/
Connecting to Google cloud with 3rd party tools: https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/connecting-advanced#thirdpartytools
This MIGHT help: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmh94mNQHQc can't figure out how to do the stuff in comments...
keycomment in putty is ACTUALLY the username you usse to connect!
second putty user is username: joek2 password: 1Gorlokfan
username for key = jbkel passphrase=iamcool
ESCDA key files: key comment: ecdsa-key-20200425 passphrase: spaghetti

ssh -i D:/Go_Workspace/src/mark_dj_website/extraneous_files/keyfiles/mark-private-keyv2.ppk jbkel@34.69.35.146

Above dosen't work...I dunno, maybe I can use git to get the stuff up there?
