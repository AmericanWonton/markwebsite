Okay, we've learned how to parse files in go and we're going to start making mark a basic ass website!
First things first, let's get all his photos off of Facebook...cuz they look good. The plan is to plop them into
extraneous_files, then decide which can go into img when we want to play with them.

Things to mess with: 
1. Facebook APIS. Might need for videos or messaging:

So I got a majority of Mark's photos but IDK if he's on Twitter...so it looks like just Facebook...
